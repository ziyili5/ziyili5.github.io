This study uses the Ecosys model to evaluate 15 nitrogen application strategies in continuous corn fields in Illinois, finding that fall applications have the lowest nitrogen use efficiency, side-dress applications at earlier growth stages (V1-V12) maximize yield, side-dress reduces nitrogen leaching compared to spring application except after heavy precipitation, and side-dress applications increase N₂O emissions due to higher temperatures and precipitation during the growing season.
