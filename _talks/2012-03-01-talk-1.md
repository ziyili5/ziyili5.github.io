This study uses the Ecosys agroecosystem model to evaluate how pre-growing season weather conditions (temperature and precipitation) affect corn yield response to nitrogen fertilizer in the U.S. Midwest, finding that warmer conditions increase yield through enhanced nitrogen mineralization and reduced leaching, while wetter conditions reduce yield due to greater nitrogen loss, with colder conditions having the most significant negative impact.
