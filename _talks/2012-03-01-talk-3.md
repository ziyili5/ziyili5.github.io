This study enhances the existing Maximum Return to Nitrogen (MRTN) method for N fertilizer recommendations in Illinois cornfields by integrating environmental costs (N leaching and Nâ‚‚O emissions) using the Ecosys model and clustering fields based on soil and weather conditions, providing spatially explicit N rate recommendations to balance productivity, economic return, and environmental sustainability.
