This study uses the Ecosys model to evaluate the impacts of corn-soybean rotation versus continuous corn on nitrogen and carbon dynamics in Illinois, finding that the rotation enhances corn yield through increased soil mineralization and nitrogen uptake, reduces nitrogen-related emissions and leaching, but slightly lowers long-term soil organic carbon compared to continuous corn, providing insights into the economic and environmental benefits of crop rotations in the U.S. Midwest.
