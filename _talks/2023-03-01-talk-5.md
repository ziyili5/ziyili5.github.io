This study uses the Ecosys model to evaluate the impacts of nitrogen fertilizer application strategies (timing, rates, and additives) under varying environmental conditions in the U.S. Midwest, revealing how fall, spring, and side-dress applications influence crop yield and nitrogen losses, while providing insights and guidance for optimizing N management to enhance productivity and environmental sustainability.
