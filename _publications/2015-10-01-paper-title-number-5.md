title: "Distinct driving mechanisms of non-growing season N2O emissions call for spatial-specific mitigation strategies in the US Midwest"

excerpt: 'This study uses an advanced process-based model to show that non-growing season (NGS) Nâ‚‚O emissions in the US Midwest contribute significantly to annual emissions, are driven by regional differences in precipitation and temperature, and can be mitigated through spatially explicit strategies such as spring fertilizer application and nitrification inhibitors to reduce emissions and maximize social benefits.'
