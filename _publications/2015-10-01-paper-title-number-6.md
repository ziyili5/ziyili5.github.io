title: "Evaluation of average leaf inclination angle quantified by indirect optical instruments in crop fields"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-5
excerpt: 'This study evaluates the performance of three indirect optical instruments—LAI-2200, 30°-tilted camera, and digital hemispherical photography (DHP)—for measuring average leaf inclination angle (ALA), finding that LAI-2200 and the 30°-tilted camera outperform DHP, with a modified LAI-2200 algorithm further improving accuracy, while highlighting the 30°-tilted camera as a cost-effective solution for continuous canopy structure monitoring.'
