The course is targeted at graduate students. Students will gain a deep understanding of how the physical environment affects the physiological status plants and how status and capacity of plants and the underlying soil affect their physical environment. The nature of this course is very multi- and inter-disciplinary, drawing on aspects of micrometeorology, soil physics, physiological ecology, ecosystem ecology and biogeochemistry. This course accomplishes its goals by examining the physical, biological and chemical processes that affect the transfer of momentum, energy and material (water, CO2, and atmospheric trace gases) between vegetation and the atmosphere. Instrumentation and measurements, associated with the study of plant biometeorology, are also discussed.
