I am Ziyi Li, an Phd students in University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign conducting multidispline studies to solve problems related to nitrogen cycling in the agroecosystems. I am also a lifelong learner who wishes to study the state-of-art techniques, including machine learning and deep learning.

My research interests
======
I am fousing on combining measurements data (field measurements and remote sensing data), and advanced bipgeochemical modeling tools to solve practical problems in agriculture field, including management practices like fertilizer application, crop rotations, and tile drainage. Basically, I want to integrate differents methods to help quantity the nitrogen cycling processes in the environment, like crop N uptake (crop productivity), Nitrous oxide emissions, and nutrients leaching.
